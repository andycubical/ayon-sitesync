"""Adds state of published representations for syncing.

Each published representation might be marked to be synced to multiple
sites. On some might be present (by default 'studio'), on some needs to
be synchronized.

It always state at least for 'studio' (even if SiteSync is disabled, in case
of enabling, every artists can start synchronizing without any updates to DB).

This plugins depends on logic in `integrate`. It is meant to be backward
compatible. Approach should be refactored after v3 is gone.
